This project contains the `configure_video_output.py` file which reads the data from the specified video file and masks it to only output the layers containing the fresh produce.

The file, even though expects resolution for the video, does not change the resolution from 400*240 and so that is the configuration needed for the output file to run correctly as well.

All of the development for this project was completed in a single day, along with the web development exercise including the learning curve for Open CV. The project was intended to also extend the service out as a Django REST API but in lieu of time, this couldn't be achieved. The idea for the API was to accept the POST parameters from the API call, including a "file" to be processed, which would have then been first stored locally after copying it from the `request.POST["file"]`, then be worked upon as is the case with the current video data stored locally in the `/data/` folder. This API would then have triggered a download by returning the HttpResponse with a content_type of a mp4 file and a `"content-Disposition"` tag explaining the name of the file and extension.

This service would then have been engulfed by the React application which would make the POST request and expect the HttpResponse to initiate the file download.
